## GUIDE FOR CATS LIBRARY:

### Overview of the Components in the Cats Ecosystem:
* Abstract type classes & their methods (e.g. Monad, Functor, Applicative, Semigroup) - "_Code to abstractions not concrete implementations_"
* Data types - Real world data structures/types that each have their own functionality & use-cases
* Cats Effects - Adds onto the Cats Library with extra type-classes & data-types, dealing with concurrency, parallelism and running fibers. <p>

### #1 - Docs Folder:
Contains the guide documents.

### #2 - Start Folder:
Contains a short demo on why type-classes are useful and a demo on how to use Monads.

### #3 - Type Class Folder:
 * Within each Create Folder:
   * Describes what each type-class does and provides a simplified API for each. <br>
   * All of this is already built-in to the Cats library, so the user doesn't have to define these in their code.

 * Within each Using Folder:
   * Provides an example of how each type class is used

### #4 - Data types Folder:
For each data type that Cats provides, describes what each does and provides an example of using it.
